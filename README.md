# Inver

This repository contains a basic directory structure for the **Alquiler Vehiculos** project. It already includes working user authentication and a profile section for clients. Other pieces of the system are still being developed.

## Implemented features

- Login and logout with session handling.
- Client profile page with tabs for personal data, payments and invoices, and rentals.

## Incomplete areas

- Employee and administrator modules.
- Additional management functionality for rentals and payments.

## Running the project

1. Ensure you have PHP installed (version 7.4 or later).
2. From the repository root, start the PHP development server:

   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000 -t alquiler_vehiculos
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser to see the application entry point.

More application logic will be added to these directories as development continues.
