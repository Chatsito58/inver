This repository contains a basic directory structure for the **Alquiler Vehiculos** project. All PHP files currently contain placeholder content.

## Running the project

1. Ensure you have PHP installed (version 7.4 or later).
2. From the repository root, start the PHP development server:

   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000 -t alquiler_vehiculos
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser to see the application entry point.

The actual application logic should be implemented within the created directories and files.
